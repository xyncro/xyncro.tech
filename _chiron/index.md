title: QuickStart
---

This is the place to get started using __Chiron__, an open source library for working with JSON in [F#][fsharp]. The simplest way to get started is to get Chiron from NuGet:

```shell
PM> Install-Package Chiron
```

We're working on [Guides][guides] and reference content for working with Chiron, so keep an eye on the [Updates][updates], and follow [{{ site.twitter.name }}][twitter] on Twitter.

## Chat

If you want to ask any questions on Chiron, or have suggestions, please come along and chat in the [Chiron Room][room].

## Packages and Source

For more on available packages for Chiron, see the [Packages][packages] section, or if you're interested in the source (contributions are more than welcome) see [Source][source].

## Acknowledgements

Chiron has gained various new features and approaches over time thanks to some great contributions. Particular gratitude must go to [Marcus Griep][griep], [Henrik Feldt][feldt], and [Michael Newton][newton] for their contributions, which have made Chiron safer and more usable.
